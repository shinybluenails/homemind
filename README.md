Are you curious about AI, but it seems to serve someone else's best interest? HomeMind helps you set up your own personal AI, running on your own computer in your own home. HomeMind is a desktop app that lets you chat with large language models entirely on your own machine — no cloud, no signups, no data leaving your device.

Built with Electron, React, TypeScript, and [Ollama](https://ollama.com).

Here is what some influential people have to say about the HomeMind project:

> Power to the people!

-- someone, somewhere

> An AI on every desk.

-- Ty Coon

## Features

- **100% local** — your conversations never leave your machine
- **Chat** with any Ollama-compatible model using a clean, streaming interface
- **Model manager** — browse, download, and delete models from a built-in registry (Llama, Gemma, Phi, Qwen, Mistral, DeepSeek, and more)
- **Configurable** — set a system prompt, adjust temperature, and configure context window size per session
- **Bundled Ollama** — ships with the Ollama binary; no separate install needed

## Download & Install

Head to the [latest release](https://github.com/shinybluenails/homemind/releases/latest) and grab the installer for your platform.

### Windows

1. Download `homemind-x.x.x-setup.exe`
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts
3. Launch HomeMind from the Start menu or desktop shortcut

### macOS

1. Download `homemind-x.x.x.dmg`
2. Open the `.dmg` and drag HomeMind to your **Applications** folder
3. On first launch, right-click the app and choose **Open**

> macOS may block the app on first run since it isn't notarized. If you see a "can't be opened" message, go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway**.

## Requirements

- Windows (macOS/Linux builds available but not primary target)
- ~4 GB free disk space for a small model (e.g. Llama 3.2 1B = 1.3 GB)
- 8 GB RAM recommended; 16 GB+ for larger models

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Set up Ollama

Download the bundled Ollama binary for your platform:

```bash
# Windows
pnpm run setup:ollama:win

# macOS
pnpm run setup:ollama:mac
```

### 3. Run in development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The app will launch with hot reload enabled. The Ollama server starts automatically in the background.

## Building

# Type-check + build (all platforms)
pnpm build

pnpm run build:win

# Package a macOS app
